## Chapter 19: Save Blocks to Execute Later

### Explicit Blocks

- If you add a parameter prefixed with an ampersand to the end of your parameter list, Ruby will turn any block passed into the method into a garden-variety parameter. After you have captured a block with an explicit parameter, you can run it by calling its call method
	```
	def run_that_block( &that_block )
	  puts "About to run the block"
		
	  that_block.call it that_block
		
	  puts "Done running the block"
	end
	```
- Explicit code blocks are easy and clear enough that some Ruby programmers habitually use them rather than the implicit variety
	- Explicit block parameters make it easy to determine at a glance which methods expect a code block
	- explicit code block parameter can also treat the block as an ordinary object instead of some freakish special case
	- allow you to do something that is impossible with the implicit variety: When you use explicit block parameters, you can hold onto the block and store a reference to it like any other object. And that means you can execute the block later

### The Call Back Problem

- The traditional way to solve call back problem is to build separate listener objects
	- Advantages: The listening code is separate from the inner workings of the target class, and you can swap different listeners in and out whenever you like
	- Disadvantages: you need to create those listener classes, instantiate them, and manage their relation- ships with your target class

```
class DocumentSaveListener
  def on_save( doc, path)
    puts "Hey, I've been saved!"
  end
end

class Document
  attr_accessor :save_listener

  def save( path )
    File.open( path, 'w') { |f| f.print( @contents ) }
    save_listener.on_save( self, path ) if save_listener
  end 
end

doc = Document.new( 'Example', 'Russ', 'It was a dark...' )
doc.save_listener = DocumentSaveListener.new
doc.save( 'example.txt' )
```

### Banking Blocks

- Use explicit code block parameters to solve the call back problem
	- No need for those extra listener objects

```
# using the `on_load` and `on_save` methods has
# a nice declarative feel to it—concise and clear
class Document
  # Most of the class omitted...
  def on_save( &block )
    @save_listener = block
  end
	
  def save( path )
    File.open( path, 'w' ) { |f| f.print( @contents ) }
    @save_listener.call( self, path ) if @save_listener
  end
end

my_doc = Document.new( 'Block Based Example', 'russ', '' )
my_doc.on_save do |doc|
  puts "Hey, I've been saved!"
end
```

### Saving Code Blocks for Lazy Initialization

```
# waits until someone actually calls the content method 
# before firing off the block
class BlockBasedArchivalDocument
  attr_reader :title, :author

  def initialize(title, author, &block) 
    @title = title
    @author = author
    @initializer_block = block
  end
	
  def content
    if @initializer_block
      @content = @initializer_block.call
      @initializer_block = nil
    end
    @content 
  end
end			
```

### Instant Block Objects

- You want to get hold of the object version of a block, which is actually an instance of the `Proc` class, without creating a method to catch it
	- Fortunately, Ruby supplies you with a method for just such an occasion: `lambda`
- The idea behind the `lambda` method is that you pass it a code block and the method will pass the corresponding `Proc` object right back at you

```
class Document
  DEFAULT_SAVE_LISTENER = lambda do |doc, path| 
    puts "Saved: #{path}"
  end
	
  attr_accessor :title, :author, :content
	
  def initialize( title, author, content='' )
    @title = title
    @author = author
    @content = content
    @save_listener = DEFAULT_SAVE_LISTENER
  end
end
```

### Staying Out of Trouble

- When it comes to creating `Proc` objects, beware of false friends. Although calling `Proc.new`(`from_proc_new = Proc.new { puts "hello from a block" }`) is nearly synonymous with `lambda`, the object you get back from `Proc.new` differs from what you would get back from `lambda` in two key ways
	- `Proc.new` object is very forgiving of the number of arguments passed to its call method. In contrast, the call method on an object returned by `lambda` acts more like a regular method and will throw an exception if you mess up the argument count
	- Objects from `Proc.new` feature all of the interesting `return`,` break`, and `next` behavior that we touched on in the last couple of chapters
		- For example, if a `Proc.new` block executes an explicit return, Ruby will try to return not just from the block but from the method that created the block
		- the `Proc` object returned from `lambda` acts more like a portable method—a return from a `lambda` wrapped block will simply return from the block and no further
	- Lesson one is that if you are calling a method that takes a block, pause for a second before you put a return, next, or break in that block
	- Lesson two is that if you want a block object that behaves like the ones that Ruby generates when you pass a couple of braces into a method, use `Proc.new`. If you want something that will behave more like a regular object with a single method, use `lambda`
- the closure nature of code blocks
	- The fact that code blocks drag along the variables from the code that defines them is mostly a convenience, but it can also have unexpected and unpleasant consequences. (Mostly this has to do with variables staying in scope, and therefore in existence, for longer than you might expect)
	```
	# good practice
	# you should keep in mind the stuff that you might 
	# be unconsciously dragging along with your blocks
	def some_method(doc)
	  big_array = Array.new(10000000)
	  # Do something with big_array... 
		
	  # And now get rid of it! 
	  big_array = nil
		
	  doc.on_load do |d|
	    puts "Hey, I've been loaded!"
	  end 
	end
	```
