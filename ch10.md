## Chapter 10: Construct Your Classes from Short, Focused Methods

- Most Ruby programmers favor very short methods, methods that stick to doing one thing and doing it well

### Compressing Specifications

original version:
```
# TextCompressor class takes text string as argument and 
# produce two arrays; the first array will contain all the unique
# words in the original text, the second array will contain
# integer indexes

class TextCompressor
  attr_reader :unique, :index
	
  def initialize( text )
    @unique = []
    @index = []
		
    words = text.split
    words.each do |word|
      i = @unique.index( word )
      if i
        @index << i
      else
        @unique << word
        @index << unique.size - 1
      end
    end
  end
end
```

optimized version:
```
class TextCompressor
  attr_reader :unique, :index
	
  def initialize( text )
    @unique = []
    @index = []
		
    add_text( text )
  end

  def add_text( text )
    words = text.split
    words.each { |word| add_word( word ) }
  end
	
  def add_word( word )
    i = unique_index_of( word ) || add_unique_word( word )
    @index << i
  end
	
  def unique_index_of( word )
    @unique.index( word )
  end
	
  def add_unique_word( word )
    @unique << word
    unique.size - 1
  end
end
```

### Composing Methods for Humans

- Technique we've done to `TextCompressor` class is to apply the composed method technique
- composed method technique
	- advocates dividing class up into methods
	- 3 characteristics
		- each method should do a single thing (focus on solving a single aspect of the problem)
			- easier to write and understand
		- each method needs to operate at a single conceptural level (don't mix high-level logic with the nitty-gritty details)
		- each method needs to have a name that reflect its purpose
	
### Composing Ruby Methods

- Having many fine-grained methods also tends to make your classes easier to test

### One Way Out?

- For methods having multiple returns using composed method technique

```
def prose_rating
  return :really_pretentious if really_pretentious?
  return :somewhat_pretentious if somewhat_pretentious?
  return :really_informal if really_informal?
  return :somewhat_informal if  somewhat_informal?
  return :about_right
end

def really_pretentious?
  pretentious_density > 0.3 && informal_density < 0.2
end

def somewhat_pretentious?
  pretentious_density > 0.3 && informal_density >= 0.2
end

def really_informal?
  pretentious_density < 0.1 && informal_density > 0.3
end

def somewhat_informal?
  pretentious_density < 0.1 &&  informal_density <= 0.3
end

def pretentious_density
  # Somehow compute density of pretentious words
end

def informal_density
  # Somehow compute density of informal words
end
```

### Staying Out of Trouble

- Remember every method should have two things going for it
	- it should be short (compact)
	- it should be coherent (do something)

bad example:
```
class TextCompressor
  # ...
	
  def add_unique_word( word )
    add_word_to_unique_array( word )
    last_index_of_unique_array
  end
	
  def add_word_to_unique_array( word )
    @unique << word
  end
	
  def last_index_of_unique_array
    unique.size - 1
  end
end
```
