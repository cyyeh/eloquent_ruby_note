## Chapter 16: Use Modules as Mixins

### Mixin Modules to the Rescue

- The way to solve the problem of sharing code among otherwise unrelated classes is by creating a mixin module

- The Ruby jargon is that by including a module in a class you have mixed it in to the class. (The module itself is a mixin module)
```
class Document
  include ModuleName
  # Lots of stuff omitted...
end
```
- If you have several unrelated classes that need to share some code, you donâ€™t have to resort to restructuring your whole inheritance tree to get at that code. All you need to do is wrap the common stuff in a module and include that module in the classes that need it.

### Extending a Module

- Sometimes you want to pull in a module so that all the methods in the module become class methods
	```
	# First way
	class Document
	  # Most of the class omitted...
		
	  class << self
	    include Finders
	  end 
	end
	
	# Second way
	class Document
	  extend Finders
	end
	```

### Staying Out of Trouble

- When you mix a module into a class, Ruby rewires the class hierarchy a bit, inserting the module(before the superclass) as a sort of pseudo superclass of the class
	- No matter how many modules a class includes, instances of the class will still claim to be, well, instances of the class
	```
	# class hierarchy from parent to child: 
	# Document -> PoliticalBook -> 
	# WritingQuality -> PoliticalWritingQuality
	class PoliticalBook < Document
	  include WritingQuality
	  include PoliticalWritingQuality
	  # Lots of stuff omitted...
	end
	```
- Since mixing in a module sets up an inheritance relationship between the including class and the module, you need to let your users know what that relationship is going to be before they start mixing. You should always add a few concise comments to your creation stating exactly what it expects from its including class
