## Chapter 14: Use Class Instance Variables

### A Quick Review of Class Variables

- class variable
	- start with two @'s 
	- associated with a class instead of an ordinary instance
	- visible to instances of the class
	```
	class Document
	  @@default_paper_size = :a4
		
	  def self.default_paper_size
	    @@default_paper_size
	  end
		
	  def self.default_paper_size=(new_size)
	    @@default_paper_size = new_size
	  end
	end
	```
	
### Wandering Variables

- How Ruby looks up the value of a class variable
	- Ruby starts with the current class and looks up the inheritance tree; it either finds the variable or runs out of classes and throws a NameError exception
- The real problem with class variables is that they are not so much variables attached to a specific class as they are global variables with a slightly restricted realm. In fact, Rubyist David Black calls class variables “vertical global variables,” vertical in that they are restricted to a single inheritance tree and global in that they are very visible within that tree

### Class Instance Variables and Subclasses

- Different from class variables, class instance variables from subclass can be completely separate from subclas

### Adding Some Convenience to Your Class Instance Variables

- With `attr_accessor` to get and set an instance variable
```
class Document
  attr_accessor :default_font
end
```
- Trick to defining class-level attributes
```
class Document
  @default_font = :times
	
  class << self
    attr_accessor :default_font
  end
end
```

### Staying Out of Trouble

- A better strategy is to reread the title of this chapter and stick to class instance variables
