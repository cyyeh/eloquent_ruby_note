## Chapter 18: Execute Around with a Block

### Add a Little Logging

- Delivering code where it is needed is exactly what code blocks do so well
```
# It's obvious what is going on: loading and saving document
# with_logging is general
class SomeApplication
  def do_something
    with_logging('load') { @doc = Document.load( 'resume.txt' ) }
		
    # Do something with the document...
		
    with_logging('save') { @doc.save } 
  end
  		
  def with_logging(description)
    begin
      @logger.debug( "Starting #{description}" )
      yield
      @logger.debug( "Completed #{description}" )
    rescue
      @logger.error( "#{description} failed!!")
      raise
    end 
  end
end
```

### When It Absolutely Must Happen

- This simple “bury the details in a method that takes a block” technique goes by the name of execute around
	- something needs to happen before or after some operation, or when the operation fails with a exception

### Setting Up Objects with an Initialization Block

- Using execute around for initialization is generally less about making sure that things happen in a certain sequence and more about making the code readable: Here, it says, is the code that sets up the new object

```
class Document
  attr_accessor :title, :author, :content
	
  def initialize(title, author, content = '')
    @title = title
    @author = author
    @content = content
    yield( self ) if block_given?
  end
end

new_doc = Document.new( 'US Constitution', 'Madison', '' ) do |d|
  d.content << 'We the people'
  d.content << 'In order to form a more perfect union'
  d.content << 'provide for the common defense'
end
```

### Dragging Your Scope along with the Block

- A key part of doing a successful execute around method is paying attention to what goes into and what comes out of the code block
- All of the variables that are visible just before the opening `do` or `{` are still visible inside the code block
	- the only arguments you should pass from the application into an execute around method are those that the execute around method itself, not the block, will use
	- there is nothing wrong with the execute around method passing arguments that originate in the method itself into the block; in fact, many execute around methods do exactly that
	```
	def with_database_connection( connection_info )
	  connection = Database.new( connection_info )
	  begin
	    yield( connection ) 
	  ensure
	    connection.close
	  end
	end
	```
	
### Carrying the Answers Back

- Another thing you need to consider with execute around methods is that the application might want to return something from the block
```
# capture the return value from the block and returns it as
# itw own return value
def with_logging(description)
  begin
    @logger.debug( "Starting #{description}" ) 
    return_value = yield
    @logger.debug( "Completed #{description}" ) 
    return_value
  rescue
    @logger.error( "#{description} failed!!")
    raise
  end 
end
```

### Staying Out of Trouble

- Aside from making sure you know what arguments are going into your execute around method and making sure you deliver any return value out of it, the main way to go wrong with execute around is to forget about exceptions
	- The whole idea of execute around is that the caller is guaranteed that this will happen before the code block fires and that will happen after.
- Name your execute around method carefully.
	- A good name should make sense in the context of the application code, the code that is calling the method
