## Chapter 17: Use Blocks to Iterate

### A Quick Review of Code Blocks

- In Ruby, you create code blocks by tacking them on to the end of a method call
	```
	# first form
	do_something do
	  puts "Hello from inside the block"
	end
	
	# second form
	do_something { puts "Hello from inside the block" }
	```
- When you tack a block onto the end of a method call, Ruby will package up the block as sort of a secret argument and (behind the scenes) passes this secret argument to the method
	- detect whether caller has actually passed in a block with the `block_given?` method inside the method and fire off the block with `yield`
	```
	def do_something
	  yield if block_given?
	end
	```
	- blocks that take arguments
	```
	def do_something_with_an_arg
	  yield("Hello World") if block_given?
	end
	
	do_something_with_an_arg do |message|
	  puts "The message is #{message}" # The message is Hello World
	end	
	```
	- blocks always return a value
	```
	def print_the_value_returned_by_the_block
	  if block_given?
	    value = yield
	    puts "The block returned #{value}"
	  end
	end
	
	print_the_value_returned_by_the_block { 3.14159 / 4.0 }
	# The block returned 0.7853975
	```
	
### One Word after Another

- An iterator method calls its block once for each element in some collection, passing the element into the block as a parameter
	```
	def each_word
	  word_array = words
	  index = 0
		
	  while index < words.size
	    yield( word_array[index] )
	    index += 1 
	  end
	end
	```
	
### As Many Iterators as You Like

- You are also free to name your iterator method anything you like, but it does make good sense to follow the Ruby convention and name your most obvious or commonly used iterator `each` and give any other iterators a name like `each_something_else`

### Enumerable: Your Iterator on Steroids

- Why name the main iterator of your class `each`
	- stick to the Ruby convention
	- enable us to use the `Enumerable` module
		- The simple act of including Enumerable adds a plethora of collection-related methods to your class, methods that all rely on your each method
		- `include?`, `to_a`, `find`, `find_all`, `each_cons`(takes an integer and a block, and will repeatedly call the block, each time passing in an array of consecutive elements from the collection), `each_slice`, `sort`(if the elements in your collection define the `<=>` operator)
		- `Enumerator` class (comes with `Enumerable`)
			- passing in your collection and the name of the iterating method, what you will get is an object that knows how to sequence through your collection using that method
			```
			doc = Document.new('example', 'russ', "We are all characters")
			enum = Enumerator.new( doc, :each_character )
			# you will end up with an object with all of the nice Enumerable methods based on the each_character method
			```

### Staying Out of Trouble

- To get out of mid-block
	- call `return`, `break` inside of a block
	- like exceptions, both `break` and `return` will trigger any surrounding `ensure` clauses
	```
	def each_name
	  name_server = open_name_server
		
	  begin
	    while name_server.has_more?
	       yield name_server.read_name
	    end
	  ensure
	    name_server.close
	  end
	end
	
	doc.each_word do |word|
	  count += 1
	  break if word == 'Tuesday' 
	end
	```
