## Chapter 15: Use Modules as Name Spaces

### A Place for Your Stuff, with a Name

- A Ruby module is the container part of a class without a factory. You can’t instantiate a module, but you can put things inside of a module. Modules can hold methods, constants, classes, and even other modules
- To get at that font class above you just say `Rendering::Font`
```
module Rendering
  class Font
    attr_accessor :name, :weight, :size
		
    def initialize( name, weight=:normal, size=10 )
      @name = name
      @weight = weight
      @size = size
    end
    # Rest of the class omitted...
  end
end
```

- Advantages for wrapping a module around classes
	- group together related classes
	- when you put the Font class inside of a module, you are dramatically reducing the probability that your Font class and someone else’s Font class will be injured in a name collision

- To get constants, same as getting class in modules, say `Rendering::DERAULT_PAPER_SIZE`
```
module Rendering
  # Font and PaperSize classes omitted...
	
	# constants
  DEFAULT_FONT = Font.new( 'default' )
  DEFAULT_PAPER_SIZE = PaperSize.new
end
```

- If you get tired of all this Render:: typing, you can include the module
```
include Rendering

puts DEFAULT_PAPER_SIZE
```

- Note if you do nest modules, you will need to dig deeper to find stuff inside
	- Nest the Font class two modules deep and you will either have to include the `WordProcessor::Rendering` module or utter `WordProcessor::Rendering::Font` in one breath

### A Home for Those Utility Methods

- call module-level methods directly from modules
	- `WordProcessor.inches_to_points( 1.0 )` (generally)
	- `WordProcessor::inches_to_points( 1.0 )`

```
module WordProcessor
  def self.points_to_inches( points )
    points / 72.0
  end
  def self.inches_to_points( inches )
    inches * 72.0
  end
  # Rest of the module omitted
end
```

### Building Modules a Little at a Time

- You can define your modules in several pieces, spread over a number of source files.
	- The first file defines the module and the rest of the files simply add to it

### Treat Modules Like the Objects That They Are

- Modules are just objects.
	- We can point a variable at a module and then use that variable in place of the module
	```
	the_module = Rendering
  times_new_roman_font = the_module::Font.new('times-new-roman' )
	```
- You can take advantage of the object-ness of modules to swap out whole groups of related classes and constants—and even sub-modules!—at runtime.

### Staying Out of Trouble

- When should you create a name space module and when should you let your classes go naked?
	- An easy rule of thumb is that if you find yourself creating a lot of names that all start with the same wor
- If you want to enclose stand-alone utility methods in a module, make sure that you define those methods as module-level methods.
	```
	module WordProcessor
	  def self.points_to_inches( points ) # use self
	    points / 72.0
	  end
	  # etc... 
	end
	```
- Remember, the goal is clear and concise code. And don't do this
	```
	module Subsystem
	  module Output
	    module Rendering
	      module GlyphSet
	        class Font
	          #...
	```
