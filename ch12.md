## Chapter 12: Create Classes That Understand Equality

### An Embarrassment of Equality

- Ruby's `Object` class defines no less than four equality methods
	- `eql?`, `equal?`, `==`, `===`

- `equal?`
	- Ruby uses this method to test for object identity. In other words, the only way that `x.equal?(y)` should ever return true if x and y are both references to identically same objects

### Double Equals for Everyday Use

- `==`
	- Testing for object identity(same as `equal?`) is just the default behavior for this method, you are free to implement any kind of "same value" comparison that makes sense for your object
	```
	def ==(other)
	  ...
	  return false unless other.instance_of?(self.class) # other must be instance of the same class
	  ...
  end
	```
	
### Broadening the Appeal of the == Method

broadening equal conditions
```
# using kind_of?
def ==(other)
  ...
  return false unless other.kind_of?(self.class) # other be instance of the same class or subclass
  ...
end 

# using respond_to?
def ==(other)
  ...
  return false unless other.respond_to?(:folder) # if other also has folder method
  ...
end 
```

### Well-Behaved Equality

- The problem we have is that we defined equality relationships that violate the principal of symmetry: People tend to expect that if `a == b` then `b == a`
- Another built-in assumption we have about equality is that if `a == b` and `b == c`, then surely `a == c`. This transitive property is another expectation that is all too easy to violate

### Triple Equals for Case Statements

- `===`
	- mainly used in `case` statements
	- the `Regexp` class has a `===` method that does pattern matching when confronted with a string
	- By default, `===` calls the double equals method, so unless you specifically override `===`, wherever you send `==`, `===` is sure to follow. It’s probably a good idea to leave `===` alone unless doing so results in really ugly case statements

### Building a Well-Behaved Hash Key

- The `Hash` class calls the aptly named `hash` method (another one of those methods that you inherit from `Object`) to get the hash code from its keys. The `Hash` class uses the `eql?` method to decide if two keys are in fact the same key
- The default `eql?` returns true only if the other object is identically the same as this object (like `==` and `===`)

### Staying Out of Trouble

- If it ain’t broke—or used—don’t fix it. Many objects will never find themselves in the middle of an equality expression or be called upon to be a hash key. If you have an object like this, then just leave its equality methods alone
- Even if you do need to implement some or all of the equality methods, you might be able to lean on someone else’s work
- Finally, if you do need to write your own equality methods, do the simplest thing that will work. If you don’t have to support equality across different classes, then don’t. A limited, but working implementation is better than an elaborate and subtly broken one
