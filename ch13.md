## Chapter 13: Get the Behavior You Need with Singleton and Class Methods

### A Stubby Puzzle

- singleton method (nothing to do with the Singleton Pattern of design patterns)
	- a method that is defined for exactly one object instance
	- define a singleton method with `def instance.method_name`
	- Singleton methods are in all respects ordinary methods: They can accept arguments, return values, and do anything else that a regular method can do. The only difference is that singleton methods are stuck to a single object instance
	- Singleton methods override any regular, class-defined methods
	- instances of the numeric and symbols don't support singleton methods
	```
	# alternative syntax for defining singleton methods
	
	hand_built_stub_printer = Object.new
	
	class << hand_built_stub_printer
	  def available? # singleton method
	    true
	  end
		
	  def render # singleton method
	    nil
	  end
	end
	```
	
### A Hidden, but Real Class

- Every Ruby object carries around an additional, somewhat shadowy class of its own, the singleton class.
	- It sits between every object and its regular class
	- Itâ€™s only when you add something to it that the singleton class steps out of the shadows and makes its existence felt

### Class Methods: Singletons in Plain Sight

- There is one particular application of singleton methods that is so pervasive that it is practically impossible to build a Ruby program without it. We even have a special name for these ubiquitous singleton methods, class methods
- Any given class, say, Document, is an instance of Class. This means that it inherits all kinds of methods from Class, methods like name and superclass. When we want to add a class method, we want that new method to exist only on the one class (Document in the example), not on all classes. Since the object that goes by the name of Document is an instance of Class, we need to create a method that exists only on the one object (Document) and not on any of the other instances of the same class. What we need is a singleton method

```
class Document
  class << self # same as class << some_object
    def find_by_name( name )
      # Find a document by name...
    end
		
    def find_by_id( doc_id )
      # Find a document by id
    end 
  end
end		
```

### Staying Out of Trouble

- Remember, when you define a class method, it is a method attached to a class. The instances of the class will not know anything about that method
