## Chapter 11: Define Operators Respectfully

### Defining Operators in Ruby

- The Ruby mechanism for defining your own operators is straightforward and based on the fact that Ruby translates every expression involving programmer-definable operators into an equivalent expression where the operators are replaced with method calls
	```
	sum = first + second
	sum = first.+(second) # the same as above
	```
- Creating a class that supports operators boils down to defining a bunch of instance methods, methods with names like +, -, and *

```
class Document
  # Most of the class omitted...
  def +(other)
    Document.new( title, author, "#{content} #{other.content}" )
  end 
end

doc1 = Document.new('Tag Line1', 'Kirk', "These are the voyages")
doc2 = Document.new('Tag Line2', 'Kirk', "of the star ship ...")
total_document = doc1 + doc2
puts total_document.content
```

### A Sampling of Operators

- Operators you can ovveride (examples)
	- binary
		- `*`, `/`, `%`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `*`
	- unary
		- `!`
	- both
		- `+`, `-`
- Operators you can't ovveride
	- `not`, `and`, `not`, `&&`, `||`

```
# define unary operators
class Document
  # Most of the class taking a break...
  def +@
    Document.new( title, author, "I am sure that #{@content}" )
  end
	
  def -@
    Document.new( title, author, "I doubt that #{@content}" )
  end 
end

favorite = Document.new('Favorite', 'Russ', 'Chocolate is best')
unsure = -(+favorite) # I doubt that I am sure that Chocolate is best
```

- Ruby programmers can also define a couple of methods that will make their objects look like arrays or hashes: `[]` and `[]=`

### Operating Across Classes

- If you want to define binary operators that work across classes, you need to either make sure that both classes understand their responsibilities or accept that your expressions will be sensitive to the order in which you write them.

```
# add a string(String class) to a document(Document class)
def +(other)
  if other.kind_of?(String)
    return Document.new( title, author, "#{content} #{other}")
  end
  Document.new( title, author, "#{content} #{other.content}" )
end

doc = Document.new( 'hi', 'russ', 'hello')
new_doc = doc + 'out there!'
```

### Staying Out of Trouble

- When should you define operators for your classes and when should you just stick to ordinary methods?
	- Like most software engineering questions, the answer to this one is a resounding “It depends.” Mainly it depends on the kind of object you are defining and the specific operations it supports
	- The easiest case is where you find yourself building a class that has some natural, intuitive operator definitions
		- `Matrix` and `Vector` classes
	- Another easy case is where you are building a class that, although it doesn’t come with a whole set of universally understood operators, does have a few operator targets of opportunity
		- easy decision to add an `<<` operator to `collection` class
	- There’s the case where, even though there are no widely accepted operators in the domain you are modeling, you realize that many of the methods on your class behave in a way that parallels the ordinary arithmetic operators
		- `department = employee_1 + employee_2`
- In any event, it is always a good idea to provide ordinary method names as aliases for your fancy operators as a sort of escape valve, just in case other programmers fail to appreciate the elegance of adding two departments together
- The mental cloud of ideas around every operator holds some absolutely unshakable assumptions—and woe to you if you violate them (because people have some strong built-in expectations of what a given operator should do. The wise coder tries to respect those expectations)
